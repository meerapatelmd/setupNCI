Description: Load the NCI Metathesaurus, NCI Thesaurus, and the
    map between both into Postgres. The NCI Metathesaurus follows the same
    standards as those found in the `metathesaurus` R package while the
    NCI Thesaurus and the Code to CUI Map are two additional tables added
    during the setup process.
